# Padherder Mass Priority Changer
For far too long I left the default priority at medium in my padherder account and didn't want to click the button a few hundred times to fix it, maybe you've had the same problem.  Luckily the excellent developer of padherder created an equally wonderful API to make this task quite simple.

Requirements
------------
- A [PADHerder](https://www.padherder.com) account

- Requests python module

Usage
------
